A Wordle solver is a tool, often a computer program, that helps players guess the hidden word in the Wordle game. It works by analyzing your guesses and the game's feedback to narrow down the possibilities and suggest likely words to try next. Wordle solvers can range from simple command-line tools to more sophisticated applications with user interfaces.
